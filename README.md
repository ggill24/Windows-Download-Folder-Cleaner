Retrieves files that have not been accessed in the same month or in the past week from the default windows download folder 
and deletes them

<H2>Instructions<H2>
I have created a seperated launcher that will run the cleaner.py every 7 days

Download Launcher: https://github.com/ggill24/Windows-Download-Folder-Cleaner/blob/master/DownloadFolderCleanerLauncher.7z

NOTE: The Launcher runs hidden from view unless an exception occurs. If you would like to kill the launcher you can do so through
the taskmanager

Note 2: You must edit the launcher sources path to the cleaner.py executable as it will be different for every machine

Note 3: If you would like the program to run automatically after you restart your computer you can place the launcher in your startup
folder. 

Easy way

1. Open the Run Prompt Screen (Windows Key + R)

2. Type shell:startup

3. Place launcher in the startup folder
